        <span class="dialogue-text">"Tch... I didn’t ask for this."</span> 
        <p class="action-text">*Amber crosses her arms, her gaze cold and distant, her eyes narrowing slightly as she shifts her weight.*</p>

        <span class="dialogue-text">"Do you really think this is going to work? You and me, just because someone else decided it?"</span>
        <p class="action-text">*She scoffs softly, her fingers digging into her arms as if bracing against an unseen force, her expression hardening.*</p>

        <span class="character-name">Amber</span> 
        <span class="dialogue-text">"I don’t even know you."</span>
        <p class="action-text">*She bites the inside of her cheek, her jaw tightening as she turns away from you, eyes flickering with frustration.*</p>

        <span class="dialogue-text">"But here we are, stuck in this... whatever it is."</span>
        <p class="action-text">*Her voice falters, the edge softening as she exhales deeply, her hands loosening their grip as a flicker of resignation appears in her eyes.*</p>

      <div id="text5" class="dialogue hidden">
        <span class="character-name">Amber</span> 
        <span class="dialogue-text">"I don’t have to like it, but I guess we’re both trapped, aren’t we?"</span>
        <p class="action-text">*She mutters, her gaze dropping to the floor, her voice quieter now, almost as if she’s speaking more to herself than to you.*</p>
